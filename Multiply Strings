# Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

# Example: Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3" -> Output: "6"

class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        if "0" in [num1,num2]:
            return 0
